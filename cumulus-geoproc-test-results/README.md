## Output Files From `python -m unittest`

This directory is mounted at `/output` inside the container when running `tests.sh` with the `-k` option ("keep" mode). This is helpful for keeping output files produced by unittest tests for additional evaluation and debugging.

All contents in this directory are .gitignored, except for this file (README.md)
